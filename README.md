# Fruit_Classification
This Repository contains Codes of the problem I worked on - Fruit Classification Problem.
This problem is completely based on identitfying which classification model has the highesr accuracy.
Let us look on to it!

1 - We have the code in the Fruit_Classification.ipynb

2 - We have the Picture of the code which got the highest accuracy ( for both train and test set ) in the Accurate Classification Model.png

3 - We have the picture of a scatterplot where we can that the highest accuracy is when k = 5 in the Graph for highest accuracy.png
